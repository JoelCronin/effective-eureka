# PWA Text-Editor

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-green)

In this project, I was approached to apply the finishing touches to some starter code that was provided to me in order to build a PWA text-editor.

To achieve this, I needed to use a lot of new tech such service workers, IndexedDB, Concurrently and Webpacks. As it is a PWA it can be installed and used offline.
